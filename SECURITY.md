### Security Best Practices

When using Modern Product Search, please follow these security best practices:

#### For Development
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use HTTPS in production

- Regular security audits

#### For Deployment
- Use secure database configurations
- Implement proper network security
- Monitor for security events
- Regular security updates
- Backup and disaster recovery plans

### Known Security Considerations

- This application uses H2 in-memory database by default, which is suitable for development but not recommended for production
- CORS is configured to allow all origins in development mode
- No authentication is implemented by default
- External API calls should be secured in production

### Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions and announced through:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes
- Email notifications to maintainers

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.
